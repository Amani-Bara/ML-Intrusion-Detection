# üîê Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project evaluates multiple **machine learning models** for detecting malicious network traffic, focusing on DNS spoofing, backdoor malware, DoS, and DDoS attacks.  
We compare traditional classifiers, advanced supervised algorithms, neural networks, and anomaly detection models to determine their effectiveness in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

## üìä Abstract
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for identifying malicious activities in network traffic. Traditional IDS often fail against novel or evolving attacks.  
This study evaluates **Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, MLP, CNN, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders**, achieving high accuracy and robustness in detecting both known and unseen attacks.

## üéØ Objectives
- Compare performance of **traditional ML models vs. neural networks vs. anomaly detectors**  
- Evaluate metrics: **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**  
- Align findings with **UN SDGs** and **Saudi Vision 2030** (cybersecurity, digital transformation, economic diversification).

## üìë Datasets
The study uses multiple **PCAP-derived datasets** containing real attack traces:
- `Backdoor_Malware.pcap.csv`
- `DoS-TCP_Flood.pcap.csv`
- `DoS-UDP_Flood.pcap.csv`
- `DDoS-TCP_Flood.pcap.csv`
- `Merged_Attacks.csv` (combined attacks dataset)
